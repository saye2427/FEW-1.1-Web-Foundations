    <h2>PRODUCT BASED EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>
        You’ll spend 2 years learning the ins and outs of computer
        science and product development through building software
        designed to impact real problems. You’ll be learning the
        same technologies, frameworks and design process used by
        tech companies.

        In 2014 we became the first higher educational institution
        to offer college financing through Income Share Agreements.
        You’ll pay tuition as a percent of earnings once you have a
        successful job in tech.
