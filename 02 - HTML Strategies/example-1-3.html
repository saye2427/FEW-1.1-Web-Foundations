<h1>Favorite HTML Tags</h1>

<dl>
    <dt><h2>p tag</h2></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Primarily used to display a block of text, usually in paragraph form.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of the p-tag being used in HTML:</p>
        <p>&ltp&gtThis is a paragraph.&lt/p&gt</p>
    <dt><h2>img tag</h2></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This tag is a <em>self-closing</em> tag that is used to display an image in your webpage</p>
        <p>It is generally used with the "src" attribute, which calls on the source of the image, which can be in the form of a URL or an image file.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of the img-tag being used in HTML:</p>
        <p>&ltimg src="http://www.thisisasampleimageurl.com"&gt</p>
    <dt><h2>br tag</h2></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This tag is an empty tag with no separate closing element, which is used to create a <em>forced</em> line break where one would not normally exist.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of the br-tag being used in HTML:</p>
        <p>&ltp&gtThis is a line.&ltbr&gtThis is a new line.&lt/p&gt</p>
        <p>Which would then display in the following manner on your webpage:</p>
        <p>This is a line.<br>This is a new line</p>
